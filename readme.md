### About the group

We want to create a social network for elected officials to get feedback from their residents on real bills & resolutions.

A few goals:

- Focus on official things: verified elected officials engaging with registered voters on actual bills & resolutions.
- Start local (alderpeople, city/county officials).
- Growth strategy: prefer fewer elected officials with higher engagement than lots of elected officials with low engagement.
- Maintaining 3rd party status / non-profit-esque/open-source-y status.

## Things to Build

- Verification: Process to verify users are residents and constituents of elected officials.
- Database: Source of truth that instills trust in the data.
- UX: Advanced notification system that creates high visibility for bills/resolutions residents would care about.
- UX: Polling system and communication UX for different bills.
- UX: Sharing system that creates a natural marketing tool on other sites/social networks.
- Pilot Marketing: Getting pilot alderperson and highly engaged residents.
- Revenue: Source of money that can sustain R&D & Growth.
